Prerequisites
----
Test on:
* Windows 10, 64 bits
* Linux Ubuntu 18 LTS, 64 bits
* MacOS

 Development Tool:
* PyCharm

 Development Language:
* Python (3.6)

 Require evironment to excute the python code:
* Anaconda
* Opencv

Environment Installation
----
You can simply follow with intruction on
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~galeotti/methods_course/assignment-itkinstall.html for installing Python and SimpleITK for Python
 or

If you already had 64-bit Anaconda installed, use the command line to enter these commands one at a time (they may prompt you with questions) to update python and install python versions of both VTK and SimpleITK:
```Python
conda update conda
conda update matplotlib
conda update scipy
conda install vtk 
conda install -c simpleitk simpleitk=1.2.0
```
 Install opencv
```Python
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

Test Demo
----
After run msa_main.py, you will get this window:
